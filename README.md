# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a basic etch-a-sketch web page where you can draw on a grid just like an etch-a-sketch!
Using the form found on the left of the page you can adjust the size of the grid for greater detail
as well as change the stroke count. The stroke count is the number of times you must pass a grid square
to fully make it black. For example, if you set the stroke to 5 there will be 5 gradients between white and black.
